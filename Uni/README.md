2. If you wish to run testing, you'll need the testing packages: navigate into the .Tests folder, and run `dotnet restore`

Running the program:
1. To run the program, you'll need to compile the code: `dotnet build`. This will create a compiled application in the bin/ folder.
2. Alternately, you can run the program directly with `dotnet run`.

## MySQL Installation and Setup
